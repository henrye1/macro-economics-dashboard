### F-02 [P2] open - Neither upstream fetch has a timeout, and a stalled token request wedges every macro route

**File:** api/src/macro/token-provider.ts:48
**Found:** 2026-09-09 by /audit (scope: current; lens: performance)
**Why it matters:** Neither the Auth0 POST nor the Core API GET passes an
`AbortSignal`, so both rely on undici's 300 second default header timeout. For
the token provider that is compounded by the shared `inFlight` promise: if Auth0
accepts the connection and then stalls, every concurrent and subsequent
`getToken()` awaits the same unsettled promise, so the whole `/api/macro` surface
hangs for up to five minutes instead of returning the curated `502`. Also
affects api/src/macro/macro-client.ts:78.
**Suggested fix:** pass `signal: AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` on both fetches, with a
shorter budget for the token call than for the upstream read.
**Resolution:** Still open at 61ee149, independently re-confirmed. Neither
`token-provider.ts:47` nor `macro-client.ts:72` passes a `signal`, and the
shared `inFlight` at `token-provider.ts:93` still hands one stalled promise to
every waiter. P2, so it does not block.

### F-03 [P2] open - invalidate() clears the cache unconditionally, so a 401 storm fires one token request per caller

**File:** api/src/macro/token-provider.ts:102
**Found:** 2026-09-09 by /audit (scope: current; lens: performance)
**Why it matters:** `invalidate()` sets `cached = null` without regard for which
token the caller was holding. With N concurrent requests all carrying the same
token that the upstream has just started rejecting, each one invalidates in turn,
and a caller whose `invalidate()` lands after a peer's refresh has already
repopulated the cache wipes that fresh token and starts another grant. The
single-flight guarantee the spec asks for holds for the cold-start path, and the
concurrency test proves it, but not for the retry path, which is the path a token
revocation actually exercises. The result is up to one Auth0 grant per in-flight
request, which is the rate-limit risk the module's own comment says it exists to
avoid.
**Suggested fix:** take the stale token as an argument, `invalidate(token)`, and
clear the cache only when `cached?.token === token`.
**Resolution:** Still open at 61ee149. `invalidate()` at
`token-provider.ts:101-103` still clears unconditionally and takes no argument.
It also leaves `inFlight` untouched, so a late invalidation can discard a token
a peer refresh has already cached. P2, so it does not block.

### F-04 [P2] open - The guide's single-indicator lookup is not proxied and answers a misleading local 404

**File:** api/src/routes/macro.ts:20
**Found:** 2026-09-09 by /audit (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** `CONSUMER-GUIDE.md` section 4.2 documents
`GET /api/macro/indicators/{code}` as part of the consumer surface, and the
section 8 error table lists its `404` ("Unknown indicator on
`/indicators/{code}`"). `READ_ROUTES` registers only the five collection paths,
so `/api/macro/indicators/GDP_GROWTH_REAL` matches no route, falls through to the
shared `notFound`, and returns `{ error: 'Not Found', path: ... }`. The console
cannot reach a documented endpoint, and the failure is indistinguishable from a
typo in our own router rather than the relayed upstream answer. The spec's In
scope list names five routes plus revisions and never mentions this one, so it
reads as an oversight rather than a deliberate exclusion.
**Suggested fix:** either add `/indicators/:code` to the relay, where the code is
opaque to us in the same way the query string is, so no new validation is needed,
or record the omission explicitly in the spec and the overview so feature 8 does
not plan around it.
**Resolution:** Still open at 61ee149. Re-confirmed against the guide: section
4.2 documents `GET /api/macro/indicators/{code}` and the section 8 table lists
its `404`, while `READ_ROUTES` at `macro.ts:20-26` registers only the five
collections. The repair commit added neither the route nor an explicit
exclusion note, so the omission is still unrecorded. P2, so it does not block.

### F-06 [P3] open - The relay buffers each upstream body twice instead of streaming it

**File:** api/src/macro/macro-client.ts:117
**Found:** 2026-09-09 by /audit (scope: current; lens: performance)
**Why it matters:** `read()` does `await response.text()`, and `res.send` then
converts that string to a Buffer for any payload of 1000 bytes or more, so a
response is held twice in memory before the first byte reaches the caller. Guide
section 6 explicitly steers bulk consumers to `pageSize=5000`, which is exactly
the payload size where this matters most for a service whose only job is to move
bytes. Impact is unquantified: no load evidence exists and the deployment target
is not configured yet.
**Suggested fix:** if this shows up under real payloads, pipe `response.body`
through to `res` instead of materialising the text. Not worth doing on
speculation.
**Resolution:** Still open at 61ee149, with one correction to the mechanism:
the repair replaced `res.send` with `res.end`, so the second copy is now made
by Node converting the string for the socket rather than by Express's
1000-byte Buffer threshold. `macro-client.ts:110` still does
`await response.text()`, so the body is still fully materialised before the
first byte leaves. Impact remains unquantified, no load evidence exists, and
there is still no deployment target. P3, so it does not block.
